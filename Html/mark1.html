Action anime will only grow in popularity alongside the medium in general, and with the constant advancements in animation technology, the genre will surely take anime to another level. While popular series like Naruto, One Piece, and Attack On Titan have incredible fights, their focus on plot and drama keeps them from being labeled as strictly action anime. The best action anime are ones that move their plots forward through fights, revealing character and furthering the story in explosive bouts.</p>

However, his lack of a quirk has always held him back, but a chance encounter with All Might after discovering a classmate in danger sets Deku on the path to becoming a true hero. My Hero Academia centers around Deku and a class of heroes-in-training at UA. This school shapes young quirk users into future heroes through fake rescue missions, combat training, and other hero-tempering tasks. With young Deku inheriting the "One-For-All" quirk, he will learn what it means to be a true hero while facing off with dastardly supervillains."
